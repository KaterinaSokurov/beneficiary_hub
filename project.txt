## 🧩 **Objective 1: Donor Resource Listing**

### 1. **Guided Online Form Requirements**

When a donor logs in, they are taken through a **guided online form** that collects structured information about their intended donation.
**Form fields may include:**

* **Resource Type:** (e.g., food, textbooks, stationery, utilities, furniture, clothing)
* **Quantity / Value**
* **Condition:** (new, used, refurbished)
* **Availability period:** (one-time or recurring donation)
* **Location:** (where the resource can be picked up or delivered)
* **Upload proof/document:** (optional receipts or verification images)
* **Contact details / preferred communication method**

💡 *Purpose:* This ensures that all listed items are uniform and complete, making it easier for the system to match them to the right beneficiary needs later.

---

### 2. **Resource Submission Functionality**

Once the form is filled:

* The donor clicks **Submit**.
* The system saves the record in the **resources** table (e.g., `resources` table in MySQL).
* The resource entry is tagged as **“Pending Admin Approval.”**
* The donor can view all submitted resources in their **Donor Dashboard** under “My Listings.”
* Admins are notified automatically that a new listing is awaiting review.

💡 *Purpose:* This ensures quality control and prevents spam or irrelevant listings.

---

### 3. **Admin Approval Process**

When an admin logs in:

* They open the **Admin Dashboard**.
* A list of newly submitted resources appears, each marked *Pending*.
* The admin can:

  * View full donor details and attached images/documents.
  * Edit or reject incomplete listings.
  * Approve resources that meet the platform’s standards.

Once approved:

* The resource becomes **Active** and visible in the **Resource Pool**.
* The donor receives an email/notification confirming approval.

💡 *Purpose:* Admin oversight maintains platform integrity and reliability.

## 🏫 **Objective 2: Resource Matching and Booking**

### 4. **System Matching**

When a school (beneficiary) fills out a **resource request form**, the system automatically runs a **matching algorithm**:

* Compares requested resource type (e.g., “Food”) with available donor listings.
* Filters by **quantity**, **location proximity**, and **availability dates**.
* Assigns a **priority score** (based on the school’s questionnaire responses — urgency, number of students affected, etc.).

The system then suggests **best-fit matches** for admin review.

💡 *Purpose:* Reduces manual work and ensures schools receive help faster based on real needs.

---

### 5. **Admin Confirmation**

The admin reviews the system-generated matches:

* Confirms if the proposed match is logical and feasible.
* Contacts both donor and school (if necessary) to finalize details.
* Upon confirmation, marks the match as **Approved for Booking**.

💡 *Purpose:* Allows human oversight to validate automated decisions before any logistics occur.

---

### 6. **Booking and Scheduling**

After confirmation:

* A **booking record** is created — linking the **school request** and the **donor resource**.
* A **schedule** is generated for:

  * Delivery date and time.
  * Pick-up or drop-off arrangements.
  * Responsible parties (e.g., logistics partner, driver, or school representative).

Both donor and school see the booking status on their dashboards:

* **“Scheduled”** when a date/time is confirmed.
* **“Completed”** once delivery or collection is verified.

💡 *Purpose:* Ensures transparency, accountability, and tracking of every donation.

---

### 7. **Urgency-Based Approval Functionality**

Before final admin approval:

* The system analyzes the **beneficiary questionnaire**, which gives each request a **priority score** (e.g., 1–100).
* Higher scores indicate greater urgency (e.g., “students have no meals today” = 95/100).
* The **Admin Dashboard** displays:

  * Resource requests sorted by **priority level**.
  * Visual indicators (e.g., red = urgent, yellow = moderate, green = low).

The admin then **approves requests starting with the highest urgency**, ensuring critical needs are addressed first.



• To register beneficiaries and donors, enabling profile updates, history tracking, and
account management.
• To prioritize resources based on urgency, determined by a scoring system assessing
student impact and shortage severity.
• To allow donors to list resources via a guided online form with item details and
photos.
• To book and schedule resources through coordinated school–donor arrangements
within the platform.
